 ### so as you see we have main tag in html code 
* html -> The user knows we are using html
 * head -> information about your web  **doesn't apper to user**  
 * body -> writing inside it,thing that apper in web pages



 ### forms in html sammary 
 >* Whenever you want to collect information from 
visitors you will need a form, which lives inside a 
`<form>` element.
* Information from a form is sent in name/value pairs.
* Each form control is given a name, and the text the 
user types in or the values of the options they select 
are sent to the server.
* HTML5 introduces new form elements which make it 
easier for visitors to fill in forms


 ### Comments in HTML
 we use this to write  comments *user can't see it* put the comments between it `<!-- -->`
 
 ### in html we have tow section for elenents 
 1. Block Elements always appear to start on a new line in 
the browser window such as `<div>`  and `<p>`
2. inline elements appear to continue on the same line as their neighbouring elements such as `<span>`.

### now what is **HTML5** MEAN?

HTML5 introduces a new set of elements that allow you to divide up the parts of a page. The names of these elements indicate the kind of content you will find in them. They are still subject to change, but that has not stopped many web page authors using them already.


   ** some new tages in HTML5 **
   * `<footer>` `<header>`
   * Navigation `<nav>`
   * Articles `<article>`
   * Sections `<section>`
   * Heading Groups `<hgroup>`
### **Process & Design**
#### ** follow this step**
   ### 1. ask your self when you creating website this question to  the best Process & Design
   * Who is the Site For?
* What Your Visitors are Trying to Achieve

* How Often People Will Visit Your Site

 ### 3. make WireFrames 
 >A wireframe is a simple sketch of the key 
information that needs to go on each page of a 
site. It shows the hierarchy of the information 
and how much space it might require.

 ### 4. Visual hierarchy
 >Visual hierarchy refers to the order in which your eyes perceive what 
they see. It is created by adding visual contrast between the items being 
displayed. Items with higher contrast are recognized and processed first.

 #### Summary
** PROCESS & Design **
* It's important to understand who your target audience 
is, why they would come to your site, what information 
they want to find and when they are likely to return.
* Site maps allow you to plan the structure of a site.
* Wireframes allow you to organize the information that 
will need to go on each page.
* Design is about communication. Visual hierarchy helps 
visitors understand what you are trying to tell them.
* You can differentiate between pieces of information 
using size, color, and style. 
* You can use grouping and similarity to help simplify 
the information you present
