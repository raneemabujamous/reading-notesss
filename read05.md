# Loops and iteration

## for statement
A for loop repeats until a specified condition evaluates to false. The JavaScript for loop is similar to the Java and C for loop.

## When a for loop executes, the following occurs:

* The initializing expression initialExpression, if any, is executed. This expression usually initializes one or more loop counters, but the syntax allows an expression of any degree of complexity. This expression can also declare variables.
* The conditionExpression expression is evaluated. If the value of conditionExpression is true, the loop statements execute. If the value of condition is false, the for loop terminates. (If the condition expression is omitted entirely, the condition is assumed to be true.)
* The statement executes. To execute multiple statements,  use a block statement ({ ... }) to group those statements.
* If present, the update expression incrementExpression is executed.
* Control returns to Step 2.

 ## Operators
*JavaScript has the following types of operators. This section describes the operators and contains information about operator precedence.*

* Assignment operators
* Comparison operators
* Arithmetic operators
* Bitwise operators
* Logical operators
* String operators
* Conditional (ternary) operator
* Comma operator
* Unary operators
* Relational operators
