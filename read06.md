# CSS
** CSS (Cascading Style Sheets) allows you to create great-looking web pages, but how does it work under the hood? This article explains what CSS is, with a simple syntax example, and also covers some key terms about the language. **


## Three Ways to Insert CSS
*There are three ways of inserting a style sheet: *

* External CSS
* Internal CSS
* Inline CSS

## Browser support information
Once CSS has been specified then it is only useful for us in developing web pages if one or more browsers have implemented it. This means that the code has been written to turn the instruction in our CSS file into something that can be output to the screen. We'll look at this process more in the lesson How CSS works. It is unusual for all browsers to implement a feature at the same time, and so there is usually a gap where you can use some part of CSS in some browsers and not in others. For this reason, being able to check implementation status is useful.

The browser support status is shown on every MDN property page in a section named "Browser compatibility" (use this to check if the property can be used on your website). For example, the compatibility section for the CSS font-family property is reproduced below.
